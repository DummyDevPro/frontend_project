<h2>What is Computer?</h2>

<p>A computer is a programmable electronic device that accepts raw 
data as input and processes it with a set of instructions (a program) 
to produce the result as output. It renders output just after performing 
mathematical and logical operations and can save the output for future use. 
It can process numerical as well as non-numerical calculations. 
The term "computer" is derived from the Latin word "computare" 
which means to calculate.</p>
